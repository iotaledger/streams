//! Streams message syntax version distinguished between incompatible changes in `DDML`
//! syntax and/or rules of processing `DDML` messages. It usually means that a new
//! command or type is added, or command proceeds in a different manner than before.
//! It can also signify changes in the `Header` message.
//!
//! Note, changes in syntax of Messages of a particular Application should be reflected
//! in `Header.content_type` field or the Content Message should implicitly support
//! versioning (ie. include `content_version` field for example).
//!
//! Streams message syntax version is indicated as the first byte in the binary encoded message.
//!
//! Backwards compatibility of the Streams implementations is welcome and not mandatory.
