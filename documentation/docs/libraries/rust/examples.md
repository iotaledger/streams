# Examples

You can find a list of example implementations in the [stream examples](https://github.com/iotaledger/streams-examples).

Additionally, there are a couple of local examples present in our [develop examples](https://github.com/iotaledger/streams/tree/develop/examples).
To run these examples, update the `.env` file with the node url you would like to use, and run the command: 

```
cargo run --release
```
