# IOTA Streams libraries

The `streams` library is currently available in the following languages:

- [Rust](rust/getting_started). 
- [Wasm](wasm/getting_started).
- [C](c/getting_started). 

## Getting Started

We recommend starting your interactions with IOTA by using a developer network. A public API load balancer is provided in the [api.lb-0.h.chrysalis-devnet.iota.cafe](api.lb-0.h.chrysalis-devnet.iota.cafe).

Additionally, the test network explorer is available at the [IOTA Tangle explorer](https://explorer.iota.org/devnet/).
