# Getting Started

To check out our examples and write and test your own code, you will need an IDE or your preferred code editor. You also need to set up your environment by following instructions for one of the languages: 

- [Rust](./libraries/rust/getting_started.md)
- [Wasm](./libraries/wasm/getting_started.md)
- [C](./libraries/c/getting_started.md)

If you need guidance or materials for your preferred programming language, you can use the following resources:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
- [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/). 
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/). 
- [MIT's introductory course to programming](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/intro-programming/#general).
