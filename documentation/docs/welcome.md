# Welcome

This section contains the documentation for the official IOTA Streams software. You can read more about the core principles behind IOTA Streams in our [streams blog post](https://blog.iota.org/iota-streams-alpha-7e91ee326ac0/).

Streams is an organizational tool for structuring and navigating secure data through the Tangle. Streams organizes data by ordering it in a uniform and interoperable structure. It is also based on our official *one source code of truth*, the [IOTA Rust library](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs). 

:::note

This library is in active development. The library targets the Chrysalis network and does not work with the IOTA legacy network.

For more information on our Chrysalis components, check out our [Chrysalis documentation](https://wiki.iota.org/chrysalis-docs/welcome).
