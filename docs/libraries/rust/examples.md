# Examples
A list of example implementations can be found [here](https://github.com/iotaledger/streams-examples)

Additionally there are a couple of local examples present [here](../../../examples).
To run these examples simply update the `.env` file with the node url you would like 
to use, and run the command: 
```
cargo run --release
```
