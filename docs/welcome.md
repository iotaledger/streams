# Welcome

This is the documentation for the official IOTA Streams software. You can read more about core principles behind IOTA Streams in the following blog [post](https://blog.iota.org/iota-streams-alpha-7e91ee326ac0/).

`streams` is an organizational tool for structuring and navigating secure data through the Tangle. Streams organizes data by ordering it in a uniform and interoperable structure Needless to say, it is also based on our official `one-source-code-of-truth` [IOTA Rust library](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs).

## Warning

This library is in active development. The library targets the Chrysalis network and does not work with the IOTA legacy network.

More information about Chrysalis components is available at [documentation portal](https://chrysalis.docs.iota.org/).
